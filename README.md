# PixelWrap

**PixelWrap** is the easiest way to build beautiful, dynamic front-end interfaces from a simple YAML schema! Just drop a YAML schema into the mix, and watch as your UI components, layouts, and interactions come to life—no need to code each element by hand. It's the easiest way to turn a simple idea into a fully functional, customizable web interface.
Define your schema and let Vortex do the rest. It’s like a designer and a developer had a baby, and it’s all about efficiency and style.


It works out of the box with Laravel and Tailwind CSS, and we’re just getting started! The long-term plan? Adapters for all the popular frameworks, so no matter what stack you’re using.


## Features:
- Build dynamic UIs from a YAML schema file.
- Support for **Laravel** and **Tailwind CSS** out of the box.
- Future adapters for popular frameworks coming soon!
